								<h3>Where it all began</h3>
								<p>My interest in IT was sparked early playing around on my father’s Commodore 64 with floppy drive.  I love to design and build things, and enjoy researching, designing and producing innovative PC builds.  I have experience as an electrical systems technician, troubleshooting and repairing hardware and software for parking meters, and am the go-to person for Windows troubleshooting and technical support for family and friends.  I’m fascinated by many things in IT, including network security, programming and the dynamic hardware landscape for innovative PC builds.</p>

								<h3>Why RMIT?</h3>
								<p>I chose to study the Bachelor of IT at RMIT as it allows me to combine my interest in IT with digital design in a well-regarded degree program.  RMIT offers me the flexibility to study online and to choose a range of electives aligned with my interests.  The courses are practical, and RMIT is known to have strong links to industry.  In addition, the online degree will (hopefully) soon be accredited by ACS.</p>

								<h3>Expectations</h3>
								<p>It is important to me that the study I undertake gives me real experience of the types of projects and tasks that I will complete in IT roles.  Over the course of my degree, I expect to learn how to design, develop, operate and maintain technical infrastructure including physical, web and cloud-based assets.  I also expect to work with peers to produce assessments and presentations, which will help me to further develop my soft skills.</p>

					<h2>Personal Profile</h2>
					<h3>INFJ    -    Auditory-Kineasthetic    -     Empathetic Idealist-Analytical Thinker</h3>
					<p>Test profiles are interesting because they can provide insight into learning and collaborative preferences.   I think the results of all three tests highlight my preferences for structure and organisation, as well as my strong listening and collaboration skills. I do tend to be a quiet worker and I actively work to resolve conflict when it arises, so I think that in forming a team, it would be good to identify people who also prefer well-defined team roles, structure and organization, and are collaboratively minded with good conflict resolution skills. The VARK test indicated that I have an equal preference for learning by doing (kinesthetic) and listening (auditory), which will have an impact on my preferred way of working and mean I need to be aware that others may not have similar preferences and be mindful of that when giving feedback or assigning project tasks.  It would be a good idea to form a team that includes the other learning style preferences so that the team has a broad range of skills to draw on and can better reflect the diversity of potential product users.</p>

			<h2>Project Idea</a></h2>
		</header>
			<p><h3>Overview</h3></p>
			<p>As the institutions of Australian democracy are increasingly viewed with distrust and disdain by the electorate Australia’s future social and economic wellbeing is under threat.  Engage is a mobile application designed to increase voter engagement and participation among young adults in Australia’s democratic processes.  During an election campaign, the application provides non-partisan candidate and policy information by electorate, and after the election it converts to a promise tracker, providing information on the winning candidate’s progress towards achieving the policy promises made.  It also includes a news feed and direct feedback form that enabling voters to contact their elected representatives with ease.</p>
			<p><h3>Motivation</h3></p>
			<p>Dissatisfaction with democracy and its institutions is a growing problem worldwide (Foa et. al. 2020).  In Australia, dissatisfaction with democracy has risen 19% since the mid-1990s (Foa et. al 2020: 19).  The majority of Australian’s believe politicians don’t know what ordinary people think, only 25% think that people in government can be trusted, and only 12% believe the government is run in the interests of the people (Cameron & McAllister 2019: 99-101).  Evidence from the 2019 Federal election indicates that voters aged under 30 had the lowest participation (Wright & Koslowski 2019).  Increasing democratic disengagement reduces the effectiveness of governance, sees ideology increasingly trumping policy, reduces accountability, and social and economic wellbeing declines (Hollo 2019; Hutchens 2019).  Australia’s future requires a democratically engaged citizenry.</p>
			<p><h3>Description</h3></p>
			<p>Engage is a mobile application with no current competitor in the Australian market.  The application has two modes.  During an election campaign, the application offers an interactive display that compares the policies (for examples based on proposed action, or committed spend) of all candidates in the user’s electorate.  When a user taps a policy area, the application will provide a list view of commitments organised by candidate (including “no policy” tags for candidates without commitments in the area).  Users can personalize the main policy display by selecting policy areas of interest to receive push notifications on candidate commitments in these areas.  Users can also view candidate profiles and their complete policy platform.  Policy areas will contain embedded links to web-based policy information and expert opinion from candidate and party websites, academics and experts.</p>
			<p>After the election is run, the application converts (by update) to a promise tracker for the winning candidate in the user’s electorate.  The candidate’s progress towards achieving each policy promise committed to at the election is tracked in an interactive graphical display.  The application also provides a news feed organised by policy area to track developments in the policy area using progressive disclosure to simply navigation and reduce cognitive load.  Users can favourite policy areas to receive push notifications when progress towards the policy promise is made or when there are developments in the policy area in the news need.</p>
			<p>Engage provides a direct feedback form (using the Member of Parliaments official email) to simplify engagement and feedback with the relevant Member of Parliament.  To reduce the risk of inappropriate use of the feedback form, users will be required to provide their fill name, email and mobile contact number.  To minimize user input, the user will be prompted to allow Engage to save their input to pre-fill future forms.</p>
			<p>Engage uses a bold and bright colour scheme and clear, uncluttered screens.  The navigation is intuitive using clear and short task flows, and a high priority is given to error minimization and forgiveness in design.  The landing page requires minimal user disclosure, the single input being an Australian postcode.  This data allows for the personalization of the data displayed and prioritises user privacy.  Engage aims to present complex information in a simple and accessible format, and regular updates ensure that the information provided is current and that it functions optimally.  The use of sans serif fonts, considered alignment and spacing, large and high contrast elements, alternative text and descriptions for media and images, and descriptive error messages improve accessibility and usability.   An in-app feedback button enables users to provide direct feedback to the research and development team supporting the evolution of the application and improving the user experience.</p>

						<h3>Tools and technologies</h3>
						<p>Technologies required to produce the application include:</p>
						<p>Photoshop for digital asset creation and UI libraries</p>
						<p>Draw.io (or similar) for process mapping of application functions</p>
						<p>Invision or Marvel App for wireframing, prototyping and user testing</p>

						<h3>Skills required</h3>
						<p>The project is feasible pplication design, development and production skills are readily avaliable: </p>
						<p>Analytical skills to understanding user needs and intuitive process flows</p>
						<p>Creativity</p>
						<p>Problem solving skills - debugging</p>
						<p>Programming language skills (including Xcode and Swift (iOS), Java (Android) or multi-platform alternative</p>
						<p>UI/UX design skills including process mapping skills, Photoshop skills, wireframing and prototyping skills</p>

						<h3>Outcome</h3>
						<p>Engage provides a tool for solving the problem of voter disengagement and dissatisfaction with democracy.  If the project is successful, there would be an increase in voter engagement among young adults in Australia and the trend towards declining satisfaction with democracy in Australia should slow.  Key impacts of the application’s success would include Australian citizens aged 30 years or younger having increased awareness of and engagement with the electoral process and candidate and party policy platforms.  In addition, the applications success should also return the focus of elected representatives to evidence-based policy and the achievement of policy promises through greater transparency and accountability.</p>  
						<p>Australia’s democratic future depends on citizens trusting its democratic institutions, returning that trust is the ultimate outcome.</p>
